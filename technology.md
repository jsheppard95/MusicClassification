# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Cleaning and exploratory analysis on the data will be done in Python using
the pandas library.

## Database Storage
MongoDB is the database we intend to use due to its flexibility of handling
`.csv`, `.wav` audio files, and `.png` image files along with the `pymongo`
interface for reading data into Python.

## Machine Learning
scikit-learn for classification of music genres based on song statistical
features:
- DecisionTreeClassifier
- KNeighborsClassifier
- GaussianNB Classifier
